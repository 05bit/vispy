## Vispy: interactive scientific visualization in Python

### Description

Vispy is a collaborative project that has two main goals: 
1) To make it easier to use OpenGL (also in the browser) 
and allow more sharing of code between visualization projects. 
2) To create fast, interactive and beautiful (i.e. high quality) 
visualizations, using a high level interface (also for big data).


### Installation

Vispy runs on Python 2.6 and higher, including Python 3. Vispy depends on Numpy and PyOpenGL.
Since Vispy is pure Python, installation is easy, for instance via `pip install vispy`. 


### About us

The core development team consists of Luke Campagnola, Almar Klein, 
Nicolas Rougier and Cyrille Rossant. We have each written our own 
Python visualization toolkit (PyQtGraph, Visvis, Glumpy and Galry, 
respectively), and decided to team-up.
Vispy will eventually replace all of our visualization libraries, so 
you can expect vispy to have all the features of our respective 
toolkits combined, and more.
