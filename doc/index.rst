Welcome to vispy's API documentation!
=====================================

Vispy is a collaborative project that has the goal to allow more sharing
of code between visualization projects based on OpenGL. It does this
by providing powerful interfaces to OpenGL, at different levels of
abstraction and generality.

This is the auto-generated API documentation for the vispy library. 
See http://vispy.org for more information on the vispy project.

Functionality is split across different submodules:
